    # display active tutor users
    # store created users in SQL
    # must store user accounts, performance_metrics, status (tutor, student, both), exam_results

# must setup javascript-based form in views for confidence for each instance of problem completion, and handle instance and store in database
# need to setup firebase auth
# must setup postgreSQL db to store users
# save and store user quiz_responses

# Build and implement confidence-based algorithm, for every 1 instance of completion {onSubmit} => {launch popup that collects user confidence ranked via 0-5}
# Scrape all problem sets for K-12 level mathematics that are high-signal, convert questions into problem sets (0/12), similar to KhanAcademy
# Ask for userâ€™s time availability to schedule learning, and also allow the user to focus on weaker problem types after assessing their baseline. 
# Weaker problem types will be prioritized in rank order based on results from popups
# Scale of distribution of matches for users (within classroom, then district, then region, then country)
